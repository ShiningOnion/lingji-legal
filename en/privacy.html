      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and process
        information when you use LingJi apps, which are designed primarily for
        language learning and educational purposes (such as vocabulary practice,
        quizzes, and background audio learning).
      </p>
      <p>
        By using any LingJi app, you agree to the practices described in this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-we-collect">
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>We may collect the information you choose to provide, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Support and feedback:</strong> When you contact us via email
          or through an in-app feedback form, we may collect your email address,
          your name or nickname (if provided), and the content of your message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surveys or optional forms:</strong> If you voluntarily
          participate in a survey, we may collect your responses and opinions
          about the app.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not require you to create an account, and we do not ask for
        highly sensitive personal information such as government ID numbers,
        passport numbers, or full payment card details.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        To improve the stability and quality of our apps, we may automatically
        collect certain technical and usage information through analytics and
        diagnostics services, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device model, operating system version, language and region settings</li>
        <li>App version, installation source, and basic usage events
          (such as app launches and navigation to major screens)</li>
        <li>Error and crash reports (e.g., via Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
        <li>Performance metrics (e.g., app startup time, network request latency)
          via services such as Firebase Performance</li>
        <li>
          Non-precise network status information (online/offline) to optimize
          offline downloads and sync behavior
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is typically processed in an aggregated or
        de-identified form and is not used to personally identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 App Settings and Learning Progress</h3>
      <p>
        To provide you with a continuous and personalized learning experience,
        we may store information such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your preferred learning language and UI language</li>
        <li>
          Quiz progress, answer history, accuracy rates, unlocked or purchased content
        </li>
        <li>App settings such as audio volume, background play options, and UI preferences</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is primarily stored locally on your device (for example
        in local databases or preference files), rather than on our own servers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-we-use">
      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information described above for purposes such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing and maintaining the core functionality of the apps</li>
        <li>Improving user experience and learning flows</li>
        <li>Analyzing which features are most used, so we can prioritize improvements</li>

        <li>Complying with applicable laws and regulations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not use your learning data to build “profiles” for third-party
        advertising, nor do we sell your personal data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ads-iap">
      <h2>4. Advertising and In-App Purchases</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Advertising (if enabled)</h3>
      <p>
        Some LingJi apps may use third-party advertising services (such as
        Google AdMob) to display ads. These services may use cookies or similar
        technologies to collect information such as device identifiers and
        coarse location, in order to provide, measure, and improve ad delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more details, please refer to the privacy policy of the relevant ad
        provider, such as Google’s
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Privacy &amp; Terms
        </a>.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 In-App Purchases and Virtual Currency</h3>
      <p>
        LingJi apps may offer in-app purchases (IAP), such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One-time purchases to remove ads</li>
        <li>Virtual currency packs or bundles to unlock additional content</li>
        <li>Promotional bundles or limited-time offers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All payments are processed by platform providers such as the Apple App
        Store or Google Play. We do not process or store your full payment card
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any virtual currency or unlocked content is valid only within the app or
        within the LingJi product ecosystem. It has no real-world monetary value
        and cannot be exchanged for cash.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sharing">
      <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We also do not share your data with
        unrelated third parties. We may, however, work with service providers or
        share limited data in the following situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics and diagnostics:</strong> We use services such as
          Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and Performance to collect aggregated
          statistics and crash reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud hosting and content delivery:</strong> We may use cloud
          storage or content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Cloudflare, to
          deliver audio files and learning resources. In the process, servers
          will handle IP addresses and basic request information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal compliance and protection:</strong> We may disclose
          information if required by law, court order, or competent authority,
          or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect our rights,
          property, or the safety of our users or the public.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All third-party providers are expected to comply with their own privacy
        policies and applicable data-protection regulations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>

        period for statistical and product-improvement purposes. If you are
        entitled to request deletion under applicable law, we will process such
        requests within a reasonable time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your
        information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
        destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or
        method of electronic storage is completely secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we become aware of a data incident that may significantly affect your
        rights, we will notify you in accordance with applicable laws and
        regulations.

    <section id="children">
      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Some LingJi apps may be suitable for younger learners or family
        learning. However, we do not knowingly collect personal information that
